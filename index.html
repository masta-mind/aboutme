<main> Hi, my name is Precious Edegbe, I Studied Mechanical Engineering. <br> It been a so great pursing my career,  but based on my love for tech I decided to dive into web development to become a successful developer. <br> CWW Tech Africa Cohort 4 crossed my path so I decided to take oppourtunity of this great platform. It has been a nice journey so far. <br> I believe that my passion for web development is my greatest strength in succeeding in the path. <br>
